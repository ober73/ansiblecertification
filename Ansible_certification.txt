--check (this is a dry run)


--start-at-task (this will start at a certain task)

you can tag your tasks in the yaml

then use --tasks "install" for example to only run that task

or --skip-tags "install"



EX:

---
- name: Create a myfile.txt
  hosts: web1
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Create myfile.txt
      file:
        path: /root/myfile.txt
        state: touch
